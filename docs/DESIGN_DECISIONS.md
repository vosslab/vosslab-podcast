# Design decisions

<!-- VENDORED HEADER: START -->
Record each durable decision about how this code and repository are shaped, once it is settled, with
the reasoning a later reader needs. Guidance Neil Voss states belongs in
[HUMAN_GUIDANCE.md](HUMAN_GUIDANCE.md), dated history in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, open discussion in
`docs/active_plans/decisions/`. [PROPAGATED HEADER - ENTRIES BELOW ARE YOURS]
<!-- VENDORED HEADER: END -->

Write each decision as a level-three heading with these four fields. `Owner` names the
authoritative code or contract document, rather than a person.

```markdown
### <decision title>

**Decision.** <the durable direction>

**Why.** <the reason it was chosen>

**Consequence.** <the constraint a future change preserves>

**Owner.** <the authoritative code or contract doc>
```

## Software design

### Propagation records consumer maintenance

**Decision.** A successful, non-dry-run single-repository propagation that changes files adds one
canonical maintenance entry to the consumer's active changelog through `devel/changelog_lib.py`.

**Why.** Propagated maintenance belongs in the repository history, while no-op runs and failed runs
must not manufacture history. Using the shared parser and serializer keeps the entry compatible with
the changelog query, rotation, and commit tools.

**Consequence.** Propagation change accounting and `.gitignore` normalization remain idempotent, and
future changelog writes use the shared changelog library rather than assembling Markdown separately.

**Owner.** `devel/changelog_lib.py` and the single-repository propagation contract.
